# NYT-BOOKS

Hi interviewer, this is my project for display today’s “paperback-nonfiction” best sellers.

I use [umi](https://umijs.org/)(a react framework) to build the application,

and use ant design for the ui framework, use less to write styles, use react hooks to write the code logic.

and node version need to be 8.10 or above.

clone the code => npm i => npm run start
